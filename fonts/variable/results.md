<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.
If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font Bakery
could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure call
(rpc).
There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/main/prebuilt/workarounds
/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** Could not find ftxvalidator. [code: ftxvalidator-available]

<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Check `Google Fonts Latin Core` glyph coverage.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/glyph_coverage](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/glyph_coverage)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Google Fonts expects that fonts in its collection support at least the minimal
set of characters defined in the `GF-latin-core` glyph-set.</pre>

* üî• **FAIL** Missing required codepoints: 0x005E (CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT), 0x00A4 (CURRENCY SIGN), 0x00A5 (YEN SIGN), 0x00A6 (BROKEN BAR) and 31 more. [code: missing-codepoints]

<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Name table strings must not contain the string 'Reserved Font Name'.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/rfn](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/rfn)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Some designers adopt the &quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; clause of the OFL license. This
means that the original author reserves the rights to the family name and other
people can only distribute modified versions using a different family name.
Google Fonts published updates to the fonts in the collection in order to fix
issues and/or implement further improvements to the fonts. It is important to
keep the family name so that users of the webfonts can benefit from the updates.
Since it would forbid such usage scenario, all families in the GFonts collection
are required to not adopt the RFN clause.
This check ensures &quot;Reserved Font Name&quot; is not mentioned in the name table.</pre>

* üî• **FAIL** Name table entry ("Copyright 2018 The Orbitron Project Authors (https://github.com/theleagueof/orbitron), with Reserved Font Name: "Orbitron".") contains "Reserved Font Name". This is an error except in a few specific rare cases. [code: rfn]

<summary>üî• <b>FAIL:</b> Checking OS/2 usWinAscent & usWinDescent.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/family/win_ascent_and_descent](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/family/win_ascent_and_descent)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
A font&#x27;s winAscent and winDescent values should be greater than the head table&#x27;s
yMax, abs(yMin) values. If they are less than these values, clipping can occur
on Windows platforms (https://github.com/RedHatBrand/Overpass/issues/33).
If the font includes tall/deep writing systems such as Arabic or Devanagari, the
winAscent and winDescent can be greater than the yMax and abs(yMin) to
accommodate vowel marks.
When the win Metrics are significantly greater than the upm, the linespacing can
appear too loose. To counteract this, enabling the OS/2 fsSelection bit 7
(Use_Typo_Metrics), will force Windows to use the OS/2 typo values instead. This
means the font developer can control the linespacing with the typo values,
whilst avoiding clipping by setting the win values to values greater than the
yMax and abs(yMin).</pre>

* üî• **FAIL** OS/2.usWinDescent value should be equal or greater than 250, but got 243 instead. [code: descent]

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Checking OS/2 achVendID.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is stored
in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.
Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/
This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.
Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** OS/2 VendorID value 'NONE' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Check copyright namerecords match license file.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/license](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/license)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
A known licensing description must be provided in the NameID 14 (LICENSE
DESCRIPTION) entries of the name table.
The source of truth for this check (to determine which license is in use) is a
file placed side-by-side to your font project including the licensing terms.
Depending on the chosen license, one of the following string snippets is
expected to be found on the NameID 13 (LICENSE DESCRIPTION) entries of the name
table:
- &quot;This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is available with a FAQ at: https://scripts.sil.org/OFL&quot;
- &quot;Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0&quot;
- &quot;Licensed under the Ubuntu Font Licence 1.0.&quot;
Currently accepted licenses are Apache or Open Font License.
For a small set of legacy families the Ubuntu Font License may be acceptable as
well.
When in doubt, please choose OFL for new font projects.</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** Please consider using HTTPS URLs at name table entry [plat=3, enc=1, name=13] [code: http-in-description]
* ‚ö† **WARN** For now we're still accepting http URLs, but you should consider using https instead.

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> License URL matches License text on name table?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/name/license_url](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/name/license_url)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
A known license URL must be provided in the NameID 14 (LICENSE INFO URL) entry
of the name table.
The source of truth for this check is the licensing text found on the NameID 13
entry (LICENSE DESCRIPTION).
The string snippets used for detecting licensing terms are:
- &quot;This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.
This license is available with a FAQ at: https://scripts.sil.org/OFL&quot;
- &quot;Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0&quot;

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Ensure Stylistic Sets have description.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/stylisticset_description](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/stylisticset_description)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Stylistic sets should provide description text. Programs such as InDesign,
TextEdit and Inkscape use that info to display to the users so that they know
what a given stylistic set offers.</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** The stylistic set ss01 lacks a description string on the 'name' table. [code: missing-description]
* ‚ö† **WARN** The stylistic set ss02 lacks a description string on the 'name' table. [code: missing-description]
* ‚ö† **WARN** The stylistic set ss03 lacks a description string on the 'name' table. [code: missing-description]
